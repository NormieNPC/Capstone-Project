## Project Overview

- In this project, I analyze e-commerce sales data to identify key sales trends, customer behavior patterns, and perform customer segmentation. The goal is to uncover insights that can help an e-commerce business optimize marketing, inventory, and sales strategies. By leveraging data analysis techniques, I aim to provide actionable recommendations to improve business operations. This is my Data Analysis project as a Capstone for my SCTP Data Analysis course
---

## Objective

The primary objectives of this analysis are:
- **Analyze sales trends**: Identify seasonal sales patterns, high-demand periods, and customer purchasing behaviors over time.
- **Segment customers**: Perform customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior, demographics, and other features.
- **Provide actionable insights**: Use the results of the analysis to help the e-commerce business enhance marketing strategies, customer engagement, and sales forecasts.

## Data

The dataset used in this project contains transactional data from an e-commerce platform. It includes the following features:
- **Customer Information**: CustomerID, Country
- **Product Information**: Description, UnitPrice, StockCode
- **Transaction Details**: InvoiceID, Quantity, InvoiceDate

### Data Source:
The dataset was sourced from [Link to dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data). 

---

## Methodology

This project employs various data analysis techniques to extract insights from the e-commerce dataset:

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values and outliers.
   - Converting categorical variables (e.g. Description) into numerical representations for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzing sales trends over time using line charts and bar plots.
   - Exploring customer demographics and product categories to identify key purchasing patterns.

3. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - Using clustering techniques (e.g., K-means) to segment customers based on purchasing behavior, recency, frequency, and monetary (RFM) analysis.

4. **Trend Analysis**:
   -Working Progress

5. **Visualization**:
   - Creating interactive dashboards and visualizations using libraries such as Matplotlib, seaborn, wordcloud to display findings clearly.

## Analysis Results

In this section, you will provide a summary of the key findings from my analysis.

### Key Insights:

 WORK IN PROGRESS 
 
- **Sales Trends**: 
  - Identified peak sales periods during holiday seasons (e.g., Black Friday, Christmas).
  - Noted significant growth in specific product categories such as electronics or fashion.

- **Customer Segmentation**:
  - Segmented customers into distinct groups based on purchasing frequency and monetary value.
  - High-value customers tend to purchase more frequently in specific product categories (e.g., electronics).

- **Product Performance**:
  - Certain product categories (e.g., electronics) show a clear seasonal trend, with higher sales during the winter months.
  
- **Recommendations**:
  - Focus on personalized marketing strategies for high-value customers.
  - Optimize inventory management during peak seasons to avoid stockouts.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following technologies and tools:

- **Python**: Primary programming language used for data analysis and modeling.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation.
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `wordcloud` for data visualization.
  - `sklearn` for machine learning (e.g., clustering algorithms for customer segmentation).
  - `nltk` for keyword understanding
  - `Jupyter Notebook` for interactive analysis and documentation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For performing analysis and documenting the process.

## Conclusion

### What You Learned

Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of how data analysis can be applied to real-world business problems, specifically in the context of e-commerce. I learned how to:

- Process and clean large datasets
- Use **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques to uncover trends
- Apply **machine learning algorithms** for customer segmentation

Additionally, I became proficient in using Python libraries such as:

- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning (e.g., clustering models)
- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)** for text analysis

These tools helped me manipulate data, visualize patterns, and build clustering models to segment customers. This project also deepened my understanding of how to derive actionable business insights from data.

### What You'd Change

Looking back, there are a few things I would change or improve:

1. **Depth of Customer Segmentation**: While I applied clustering algorithms, I was not able to obtain a decisive resolution within the project timeline. I would focus on exploring more advanced segmentation techniques in the future to refine customer groups more accurately.

2. **Geospatial Visualization**: I would have liked to implement a **choropleth map** to better represent the order distribution across geographical locations. This would provide a more intuitive view of regional sales performance.

3. **Interactivity in Data Visualization**: While I created static visualizations, I would improve the data visualization by making the insights more interactive. **Exporting the data to Power BI** or creating dashboards using **Plotly Dash** would allow for more dynamic interaction with the data, enabling stakeholders to explore trends and insights in real time.
